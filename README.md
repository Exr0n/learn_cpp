# learn_cpp

A compilation of solutions to competative programming problems, especially from low level USACO and 115.236.49.52:83.

## Exr0n's Handbook

This is the core of my understanding of competative programming. It is applicable to all problem solving, as far as I can tell.

### Attack Plan

1. Read question statement
1. Try sample test case to verify your understanding (NO SKIP!!!)
1. Paper work on algorithm/complexity to make sure it won't TLE (NO SKIP!!!)
1. Coding with as short codes as possible
1. Debugging(hopefully will be minimum with proper 2 and 3)
1. Make up your own test cases to test edge cases for your codes
1. AC
