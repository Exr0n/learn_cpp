# learn_cpp

A compilation of solutions to competative programming problems, especially from low level USACO and 115.236.49.52:83.

## Exr0n's Handbook

This is the core of my understanding of competative programming. It is applicable to all problem solving, as far as I can tell.

### Attack Plan

1. Read question statement
1. Try sample test case to verify your understanding (NO SKIP!!!)
1. Paper work on algorithm/complexity to make sure it won't TLE (NO SKIP!!!)
1. Coding with as short codes as possible
1. Debugging(hopefully will be minimum with proper 2 and 3)
1. Make up your own test cases to test edge cases for your codes
1. AC

### Time Complexities

My complexities graph can be found here: <https://www.desmos.com/calculator/bhq70wfqsx>.

10^8 operations is usually safe.

## Test Cases

1. Sample test cases
2. Size edge cases
   1. 0, 1, max N
3. Special properties
   1. Try to trick the greedy algorithm or something
4. Graphs
   1. No nodes
   2. One node
   3. Fully connected
   4. Cycles
   5. Negative edges
   6. Disjoint graphs
5. Recursion
   1. Base case
