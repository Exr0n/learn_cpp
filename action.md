# Action Items

- [ ] **Stay alert during contests! Don't make silly mistakes!**
    - Check understanding with the test case!
    - Memoization broken?
		- Make sure memoization array is large enough, or it could wrap
		- Make sure the arguments to the function aren't being modified
    - DJS broken?
		- Init djs!
    - Tree input broken?
		- Worst case, use an adjacency list, traverse with DFS and `pre`
    - DFS infinite loop?
		- Base cases for all arguments, both high and low end
		- Make sure you have a `pre` if the graph is bidirectional
		- Check for `if (nxt != pre)` not `if (cur != pre)`
    - Djikstra Pointers
		- No vis array, just check if `dist` is already less after popping from pq
		- Remember to set dist when pushing into pq so you don't need to do it when popping
	- Treap
		- Spot check variable names
			- `stp` vs `cur` vs `dir`
			- `<` or `>` ?
			- `dir` or `1-dir`?
		- [ ] Update treap base to have `ins` in the `insert` fxn not be a reference
			- Because otherwise it may break due to rotations
- [ ] Paper work
    - Do more of it...?
    - PSUDOCODE!!
    - Consider MLE too (not just TLE)!
- [ ] **Don't over think problems! Think transformations, not more advanced stuff!**

- [ ] Transformations
    - What if it was backwards?

	- What if it was rotated conditionally? (even/odd?)
- [ ] Advanced time complexity analysis
    - `contests/dated/2020_04_07/` 2 and 3 and 4
    - `s20o2`
- [ ] Practice algebra with inequalities, `max` and `min`, `abs`, `floor`.
- [ ] Familiarity with data structures
    - [ ] Stack, c-dated 2020_04_20/7
- [ ] Familiarity with classic algorithms (code them a bunch)
	- KMP
	- Trees (struct, see contests/dated/2020_04_29 #3)
	- Trie
	- Graph shortest paths
		- Djikstra
		- Bellman Ford
		- Floyd
	- MST
		- Kruskal
		- Prim
- [ ] "If there is some way to remember to step back and avoid my mistake in gold2019open problem 2, that would be helpful as well but I don't know how to systematically avoid that."
- Questions
	- Sparse Table
		- What's the complexity to update the table if we update an entry in the base array?
