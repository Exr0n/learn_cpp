**dont write code that you dont need to.**
`#include` is used to import libraries

in the cpp.sh default code we use libraries iostream and string
also there is always the `int main` program that is called by the process that runs it

``` default code w/ my own comments

  // Example program
  #include <iostream>
  #include <string>

  int main()
  {
    std::string name; // create variable of class string from #include <string> (std meaning string from standard library)
    std::cout << "What is your name?\n$ "; // basically print stuff
    getline (std::cin, name); // get input `std::cin` is the input from the console, and it is put into `name`
    std::cout << "Hello, " << name << "!\n"; // concat strings somehow?
  }

```

std is a library. The :: is analogous to dot notation in many other languages
`using namespace` is analogous to `from <> import *` in python, it looks for all things it cant find in the "general env" in the namespaces in order
you can use multiple namespaces. its handy. I assume that you can also do something like `using namespace lib::sublib` or something?

`getline` is an example of something in the general library and that does not need to be `std::`ed. when we namespace, everything appears to the compiler like that
  and when things like `string` or `cout` are not found, the compiler then looks in to the namespaces and finds them.

``` code v2 (typed from memory)

  #include <iostream>
  #include <string>

  using namespace std;

  int main() {
      string name_var;
      cout << "What is your name?\n$ ";
      getline(cin, name_var);
      cout << "Hello " << name_var << "!\n";
      return 0;
  }

```
