always know your algo before you write your code
be very clear about exactly what the code will do before you start writing

after you finish your code, run it and walk through and make sure it does what you want it to do
some things are easy to spot check like variables are not inited or for loops not broken correctly

eventually you should start printing out variables during the code in the middle, check that it is doing what you want it to be doing
break down the algorithm into smaller pieces to make it easier to spot the mistake.
try to output

write code that is easier to read and debug, write simple and less code: less code = less bugs
once there is a bug, try to use less time to debug: spot check (init variables, for loop values, variable names)
output important values mid code

no direct answer to how to debug, it will grow over time and become muscle memory.
