## Camp Summary
### Recap
X-Camp @ HZXJHS Summer 2019 has been a month of practice and learning surrounding computer science, C++, and algorithms. I was originally in a "level 1" class but half way through moved up to a "level 3" class to be with Alex Du and Alex Guo, who could understand the mandarin better and help explain things. They, along with Weiming, Miles, and Jason consisted of the five other kids from the X-Camp branch in the USA. Together, we learned alongside native kids that have been learning at XueJun and got a taste of school and learning culture, as well as a sense of what we  should strive to be or exceed.

### CS Concepts
During the first week and a half, I was placed in a class where much of the content was material that I had already seen. There was some new content, however, such as the ideas of DP, BFS, and DFS which I had not yet formally been introduced to. The introduction came in the form of problems and pages to grind thorugh, which I was not able to complete as quickly as others, probably due to the language barrier of both Mandarin and C++. I would be able to quickly complete problems that I already knew how to do and then get stuck for multiple days on a problem that involved new concepts or debugging a silly mistake, such as the N-Queens problem.  
Weeks 1 and 2 also gave me greater insight on debugging, especially highlighting areas where I often made mistakes. Most of my bugs stem from fencepost errors, especially when initializing variables such as in a for loop. Over the coruse of the camp I have become more adept at writing and debuging simple programs, and have a sort of mental checklist for places that can go wrong. This was built up through writing alot of code to solve relatively easy problems, which suggests that I should spend more time grinding pages in Sector 1. There are plenty of problems to do, and this has shown me that doing those problems is important.

The later two weeks of camp were spent in a higher level class, where almost all of the content was brand new and frankly above my level. However, I chose to stay in this class because I felt that it was much easier to pick up new skills, information, and concepts there because there was a higher density of new content that could rub off on me. Basically, I had to pay attention for all of class in the lower level to learn something, while here if I understood one concept I would be learning something new. The class focused on problems involving graphs and trees, which was new territory for me. I was confused for most of class and ended up not doing many problems at all during the final two weeks, and I did not learn too much from the teacher because there often wasn't one. The later weeks were spent primarily doing contests, but I was mostly unable to do the problems so I spent much of Week 3 and the begining of Week 4 researching new CS concepts, instead of working on problems. Many of the concepts I researched came from Weiming, who has a good habit of listing down things that he doesn't know. These concepts were often things that I didn't know either, so I got into a flow of researching a topic and writing about it to further my understanding and reflect on what I had just learned to digest. This is a good way to learn new concepts, but did not help me get better at writing code.  
Towards the last few days of camp, I realized that I should focus more on writing actual code. I pride myself with my long, non-plagarized summaries, so focusing time on practicing debugging (which is really the bulk of the time used to write programs for problems when you know what you are doing) seemed like an unproductive thing to do. But I realized that I will have to do this at some point, so I should probably get some practice out of the way. After all, it was because I am bad at debugging that slows me down during contests, and the only way to get better is to just do it. Remembering that this is prodcutive is one of the main things that I will take with me into the future.

The actual concepts that I researched can be found in the daily summaries that I wrote, as well as the condensed version, which can be found [here](./consolidated.md).

### Meta Learning
The past four weeks have provided many insights into things that I can improve in my own learning workflow, that can be transfered into other areas of learning and are not specific to this specific scenerio. For example, one main takeaway is that networking is one of the most important things that we can do. Additonally, when working (relatively) alone we can improve efficiency by staying on task and through active reflection. Additionally, taking a step back to analyze the bigger picture is needed whenever something doesn't feel right, or when you are doing something that goes against common wisdom. The crowd may not be right, but their thoughts have merit too. Finally, nobody can acomplish anything if they don't believe. These ideas can all be applied to other areas of life and learning, so keeping them in mind is worth the time.  
Networking is one of the most important activities in which one can partake, because eventually you will reach your own limits and need to rely on others. For example, during our time here we were able to interact with people of significant wisdom, such as those who work at successful companies or those who have started their own. They tend to hold that **"getting the right people on the bus" is important for any successful venture because otherwise a group with more/better people will easily outmatch you**. Networking is also important for any life situation because the more people you have that can and are willing to help you, the easier things become and the greater the safety net you have. Alex Guo's (new) godfather, a successful entropeneur, challenged us to make some Chinese friends that are close enough to be willing to invite you to a meal, or vise versa. However, I did not succeed in completing this challenge because in the lower class I sat next to nobody for a week, and gamers for the next. I didn't particularly want to associate with them too much, so I decided to try and focus on work. For the final two weeks, I sat in between the Alexes so I did not interact much with others. **Next time, I will try and put myself in more situations where I can interact with people, and importantly find people with whom to associate**.  
One pitfall of groups of people, especially those around my age, is that they are highly succeptable to peer presure. Additionally, we subconciously rely heavily on our peers to tell us what is "socially acceptable", which is advantagous when those around me are being good students but not as helpful when they are playing games. It is easy to get distracted from work, especially if that work is primarily pondering a question because I personally do not have a great deal of fine control on my mind (read: I get distracted if I'm not actively focusing on something physical). I don't know what the best way to combat this behavior is, but I have a somewhat effective strategy that consists of reminding myself what I am here to do and reflecting on what I am doing and if it is furthering my goals. Usually, the answer is no, so I get back to work. The primary pitfall of this system occurs when the task at hand seems too far out of reach, and this is me getting burned out. I have a hard time recovering when this happens, so a primary objective for future intensive learning sessions like this one is to **stay focused without getting burned out**, as that is more effective in the long run.  
Reflection is an effective strategy for self-driven learning, because often times information goes in one input and out the other, metaphorically speaking. It is easy to skim an article and feel like you understand it, only to try and program it and realize you don't truly understand what the algorithm does and why. One of the best ways to reinforce understanding is by explaining to others, because it forces you to cover holes in your own knowledge which are only visible from an objective outsider standpoint. Reflection is one way to simulate this, and writing it down makes it easier to see what is being missed. Thus, note taking and reflection are important because they allow the brain to process new information and break it down into more easily "digestable" chunks, which reveals missing knowledge and misunderstandings that can be patched immediately. Essentially, **reflection is needed to double check what we know and what we don't.**  
Taking a step back on a regular basis or when something doesn't feel right is important because that probably means that you are doing something wrong. It doesn't hurt to take a moment and remember what your goals are, and to evaluate whether what you are doing is actually helping, or the best use of time. Through the philosiphy of terminal and intermediate goals, we have a framework to check if all goals are aligned, and based on how wrong we feel we can decide how deep into the goal stack we need to dig to determine what to do now. For example, I was spending alot of time doing research in Week 3, but later various people reminded me that practicing actual coding is also important. I had been looking at a misaligned short-term goal of having good summaries and feeling productive, instead of the long term goal of getting better at doing the problems. This is probably the best way to stay on track given strong, aligned goals, so I should **strive to engage in this kind of reflection regularly**. This is also a good place to introduce peer feedback, because it is resiliant to haters but still allows legitamite feedback through. In other words, **ask for feedback and see if it aligns with far/terminal goals**. If so, incorporate. Else, ignore.  
Finally, all of the above strategies rely on believing in yourself. If, at any point you don't truly believe in your own ability to acomplish things, then you have reached burn-out stage and cannot do anything because you don't put your heart into it. People can sense this, and they will subconciously turn away from you. Additionally, you will not have the drive to continue on your own, and this vicious cycle will continue to make the situation worse. We need to believe that we can truly acomplish anything given the effort. This can be seen by those who have been working on something for a long time, but easily get distracted in class and end up not knowing much about what they were supposed to be learning about or doing. **Many people waste lots of time, and by cutting down on that we can be more productive and achieve more things than them, as long as we stay with belief (don't burn out)**. Notably, if you work so hard that you do burn out then that is considered a grave miscalculation because the "productive ratio" is not a short term advantage, instead it is a long term one. Time spent burnt out is unproductive, which is what we are striving to reduce so don't work too hard. And get sleep.
In summary, this experience has proved that some actions are more important than others, specifically that there are concepts to help with learning that are not fundamentally bound to CS. These concepts strive to create a more productive workflow fundamentally, through investing more time, or investing more effort, or encouraging others to invest more time and effort. The basis of all this is a unwavering belief in personal ability, knowing that even when you may seem worse than somebody else you can change yourself to become better over time, because nobody is perfect.

## Student Life
Though our time outside of class was limited, we had enough of it to relax and recharge before the next onslaught of learning. Personally, I did not spend much time out side of class working on camp related things outside of class, and instead spent some time hanging out with the other campers staying with me. Having housemates was valuable because it provided some peers to interact with, as well as people to discuss the content we learned in class. We played soccer after school each day to recieve some exercise and get some energy out, for example, and we spent much of weeks three and four playing cards, and it was a great way to wind down and take our mind off camp until the next day.  
Aside from the time we had outside of class on a normal day, we also had each Sunday off. The parents/chaperones organized outings for us on these days, which were a great break from the grind of daily life. I personally really enjoyed the outings but wish that we had two days of weekend instead of just one, because I often felt tired after spending a day going out and seeing things. The one day weekend caused a weekly delima, to stay at home and rest or to go and see the city? I always ended up choosing to go, though it would have been nice to be able to choose both.  
As for food, I was unable to aclimatize to the meals provided at school. They were edible, for the most part, but I much prefered to eat out when possible. On second day of camp, we decided to eat all three meals of the day at the school cafeteria. That only happened once. Luckily for us, we lived within a twenty-minute walk of a few great eating locations, where we would stop by for breakfast and dinner each day. Additionally, sometimes people (usually family friends or friends of parents) would invite us out to dinner, where we all feasted. Those were the good days food wise.  
All in all, student life at X-Camp was better than I expected given the small number of campers (just 6 from the US). Having housemates significantly improved the experience, and I would consider them a neccessity for future iterations of X-Camp. Otherwise, I think I could have benefited from more breaks or longer weekends to feel more rested when the next week started. I believe that the required summaries were valuable, and that they should continue to be a core part of X-Camp in the future. Finally, it would be nice to have some more kids from the US and create more bonding experiences between campers, perhaps with better organized meetups or a more structured residential system. The connections part of camp is one of its most valueable aspects, and I felt that it was somewhat improvised this time around leading to suboptimal results.

## Reflection
In general, I think I spent my time decently well at camp. I managed to stay on task for most of class, getting distracted sometimes by those around me but mostly getting work done. I feel that I could have spent more time writing code than I did, because I ended up not doing too much of that in favor of research on new topics that I had yet to learn. Socially, I did okay as far as it goes amonst campers hailing from the US, but I could have spent more time and energy interacting with native campers. Given these deviations from optimal, I am satisfied with my actions, and can safely say that this camp experience was valuable.  
During class, I was on task for the majority of the time. X-Camp was good exercise in self-dicipline in this regard due to the prevelance of distracted individuals. However, I spent much of camp doing research on computing topics that I had not yet learned, often because I could not be bothered to debug my latest code. Though I learned many new computing concepts from the experience, the habit was conducive of practicing competition C++, which was one of the primary purposes of attending camp. At the time, I had not fully digested the idea that I needed to get better at actually writing and debugging code, and that the only way to build that intuition was to practice. Spending an couple hours searching for one silly error felt unproductive, which was why I was driven towards spending that time researching instead. However, I never got better at coding and frankly, I didn't realize I needed to until I moved to the higher class, where people would AC a competition question before I finished writing my `scanf`s. That was the signal that people could code efficiently, and that I should learn to do that too.
Socially, I wish I interacted with native campers more. Although there were certain barriers, in language and geography of seats and functional computers, I did not work up the courage to spend too much time interacting with XJ students, or even formally introduce myself. This is absolutely something to work on.
However, this first camp experience has gone more smoothly than I first expected. There were no major issues with learning, language, food, entertainment, rest, etc; it was a successful first camp. Additonally, it has provided some insights into next steps for improvement, and this process will make each experience better than the last.
