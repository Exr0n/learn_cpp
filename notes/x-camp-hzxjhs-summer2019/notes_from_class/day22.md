# Summary for Day 22 (1 August 2019)

## Problems:
|  Page  |  PID  |  Description  |  Status  | Notes |
|-------:|-------|---------------|:--------:|-------|
  dev.xjoi 1216 | 1 | Weird knapsack | WIP | Combines different types of knapsack. I recognize the problem but I don't remember how to do the knapsack DP, so I was unable to do it
""|  2  | Serpentine Matrix addition | WA | didn't start focusing on this problem until too late, originally read problem wrong. Bad at math, will work on more later. 
""  | 3 | Create DAG, shortest path | WIP | Don't know how to test for loops, unable to do topological sort. Will work on more later.

#### Problem Review
**Problem 2 (dev.xjoi 1216 Today)**  
Brute force can get 260/400 points...  
Otherwise it's a math problem.  
I think they use dp somehow?
I originally thought it was just the sum of the sum of the numbers below of the numbers below, but then I realized that it was actually based on the serpentine matrix positioning at which point I had already spent an hour on the math. I then took a break on that problem to look at the other ones, and wasted a bunch of time trying to figure out how to find loops in a directed graph.

**Problem 3 (dev.xjoi 1216 Today)**  
first way find loop  
tower? edge?  
all verticies something  
It is very difficult to hear what is going on through the microphone from the other class...
