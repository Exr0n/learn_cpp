# Summary for Day 23 (2 July 2019)
## Problems:
|  Page  |  PID  |  Description  |  Status  | Notes |
|-------:|-------|---------------|:--------:|-------|
  p3.16 | 9520 | Depth of a tree | AC | Spent way too much time debugging my edgelist class
""  | 9521  |  Width of a tree | AC  | Wrote pretty quickly with another custom edgelist class
""  |  9522 | Number of children per node in trees | AC | Cheesed through it by counting connections in input format. No actual trees were used
""  | 9524  | Number of leaf nodes  | AC  | Again, no trees used, instead just parsed input
xjoi.net 3.16  | 9520 | tree depth | AC | easy with edgelist, dfs
""  | 9521 | tree width |  AC | same as above
 "" |  9522 | children of each node | AC | cheesed with arrays 
 ""  |  9524 | number of leaf nodes | AC | same as above
""  | 9500 | parent of each node | CE: TLE | should work, but the compiler time limit exceeded for some reason
""  | 9501 | weights of nodes | AC | used edgelist and dfc
xjoi.next 3.17  | 8806 | binary tree father | AC | cheesed with arrays again.

## Reflection:
|  Type  |  Score (/12)  |
|--------|:-------------:|
Productivity | 8

I was pretty productive in class today, in that I spent time in class doing problems. However, I am still rather slow at writing them even when I know exactly what I am doing. I wrote the same edgelist class five times today and got much faster at it, and I guess this kind of repitition is what is needed to get better at doing problems and debugging them quickly. So what I really need right now is to practice grinding many more problems, I suppose I should just try and do all of the problems on XJOI because that is a good pool of practice problems to get better at C++.
