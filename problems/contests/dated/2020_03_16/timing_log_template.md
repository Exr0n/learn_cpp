## Contest Reflection
1. Knowledge
What knowledge did you use in this test, and which part you didn't do well knowledge-wise?
I don't know DP very well. I came up with methods of framing problems 1, 2, 4, but my equations and code was scuffed and hard to debug.
2. Strategy
How did you spend your time during the test, and whether there's any issue about your strategy?
I spent a while looking at all the problems and then attempted to code 1, 2, before giving up. I need more DP practice before retrying this test, because I am not familiar with how to parse and internalize DP equations and reason with them effectivley, through both top down and bottom up transformations.
3. Action item
How would you change your homework, your mastery of knowledge, or class time etc in order to do better next time?
I need to do more dp practice and see more problems, so that I have a better general sense of how a problem might be converted into a dp equation and solution. I also need to think more about how to represent different parts of state - what needs to be encoded in arguments and what can be a return value? (for top down) How should things transfer? How does that change for bottom up? Recursive backtracking to update states doesn't work because you don't always do connected things right next to eachother.
