## Contest Reflection

### Knowledge
What knowledge did you use in this test, and which part you didn't do well knowledge-wise?

#### Problem 1: poj2352

sort by x, BIT on y with indirection and counting inversions

#### Problem 2: poj2481

**needs analysis**

sort by strength, indirection and counting inversions? how to only count those with overlapping ranges?

#### Problem 3: poj2886

"reverse" sieve of eratosthenes to find number with max factors under N,
segtree of open positions,
take modulo (and negatives!) of the jump, binary search on segtree to find next. (N log N simulation, stop when max factors num reached)

#### Problem 3: poj2750

After some analysis, notice that you can find the best range in a segtree that just has the array twice in a row, and limit range to N-1 in length.

At this point, it's similar to dated/2020_05_15/x5_uva1400

### Strategy
How did you spend your time during the test, and whether there's any issue about your strategy?

### Action item
How would you change your homework, your mastery of knowledge, or class time etc in order to do better next time?
