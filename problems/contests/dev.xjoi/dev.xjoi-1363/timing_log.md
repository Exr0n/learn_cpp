## Contest Timeline

| Time | Note | Next |
|----|----|----|
9:49 | confused about how #2 works, why #3 is WA, and how to do #4, 5 | analysing #4
9:53 | plan for #4: binary search on answer and see if you can fit that many cows in with the given spacing | coding #4
10:00 | AC #4 | analysing #5
10:18 | can check if all ranges overlap in N^2 | analysing #5
10:23 | check ranges in O(n) by taking intersection each time | analysing how to use binary search on #5
10:26 | have plan for #5 (multiply times and distances) | coding #5
11:03 | WA #5 | analysing #2 although nearly ready to end
11:09 | still don't understand what #2 is even asking | end

## Purify Notes

### Problem 1: simple binary search

### Problem 2: **TODO**: unkown

### Problem 3: binary search with a `works` function, dealing with floats

### Problem 4: simple `works` binary search

### Problem 5: `works` binary search with floats and dp
