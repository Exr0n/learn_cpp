## Contest Timeline

| Time | Note | Next |
|----|----|----|
17:57 | start | reading problems
18:05 | have ideas for 3, 2; 2, 1 need more analysis | psudocoding #3
18:11 | plan for #3 should work | coding #3
18:18 | WA #3 ?? | analysing #2
18:49 | not sure how to store dependencies, also my brain feels unfocused | analysing #1
19:18 | might it be just numbers w/ inversions greater than 1?? | coding #1
19:30 | didn't work, WA 12/100 | debugging #3
19:40 | WA #3 45/100, maybe time to code the LIS for #1 | coding #1
20:06 | WA and wayy TLE #1, got cases 1, 9 instead of 1, 2 this time | planning
20:09 | might as well code the brute force at this ponit | coding #1
20:13 | tilted, brute force gets 45 points | analysing #2
20:19 | no inspiration | end

## Contest Reflection

### Knowledge
What knowledge did you use in this test, and which part you didn't do well knowledge-wise?

#### Problem 1:

Didn't really get the analysis I guess.

#### Problem 2:

Wait you just binary search? I thought there was a better way because you have to use all the previous ones if you do a binary search. I guess I should've seen that because checking the previous was requiring a rescan of the entire thing... I should've went back to binary search instead of assuming against it.

#### Problem 3:

This was like that other binary search problem we did, but I didn't remember the math for it. I'm not entirely sure why I can't just do my method... #todo

#### Summary

I feel like I should be able to do these problems, although I keep going off on the wrong track. I thought some problems were ad-hoc when they weren't and didn't try to combine algorithms well enough.

### Strategy
How did you spend your time during the test, and whether there's any issue about your strategy?

### Action item
How would you change your homework, your mastery of knowledge, or class time etc in order to do better next time?
