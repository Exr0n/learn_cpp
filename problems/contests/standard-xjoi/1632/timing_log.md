## Contest Timeline

| Time | Note | Next |
|----|----|----|
11:04 | start | reading problems
11:09 | read problems, seem doable | analysing #1
11:11 | wait, 1 is not what I thought it was, it's actually range query ish | analysing #1
11:39 | not sure how to do the actual precomputation | analysing #2
12:20 | have equation, but how to precompute? | analysing #2
12:24 | wait, the whole thing is offline | coding #2
12:45 | negative nums?? might be annoying to debug | coding #2
12:58 | works for sample, xjoi down | analysing #3
13:01 | oh it's back, WA 23/100 | analysing #3
13:10 | This contest is only 3h, i should probably | coding bruteforce #1
13:16 | brute force written and TLE 28/100 | analysing #1
13:44 | probably won't get anywhere with analysis | analysing brute force #3
13:51 | don't even know how to write brute force | end

## Contest Reflection

### Knowledge
What knowledge did you use in this test, and which part you didn't do well knowledge-wise?

#### Problem 1:

would not have realized double pointers. I need to think about that method--what is it good for? where is it used? what are its specialties?
#todo summarize double pointers method 

#### Problem 2:

I think it's the same method. Would have to fix the code to be sure, I probably have some dumb typo somewhere.

#### Problem 3:

It's dp. would not have thought of that, although I hadn't even really understood the problem by that point. Probably should've seen it coming though... I guess i've been trying to be creative but in the wrong direction.

### Strategy
How did you spend your time during the test, and whether there's any issue about your strategy?

### Action item
How would you change your homework, your mastery of knowledge, or class time etc in order to do better next time?
