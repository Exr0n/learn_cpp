## Contest Timeline

| Time | Note | Next |
|----|----|----|
12:10 | start | reading problems
12:20 | read problems, seem doable but needs analysis | analyzing #3
12:28 | not sure how to do full data limit.. but I think I can get half credit | coding brute #3
12:41 | coded but RE 0? | debugging brute #3
12:44 | welp TLE 0 | analyzing #2
13:16 | have problem frame for #2 but not sure how to write equation / how to order the states | analyzing #2
13:36 | not sure how to reduce.. might as well code it i guess | coding #2 (expect TLE)
14:15 | severe miscalculation.. up to 4 means i need 3 bits | coding #2
14:32 | RE 0 stack overflow probably.. maybe use a manual stack but not now | debugging #3
14:38 | uh 5/20 cases is not 50%, RE 15 | analyzing #3
14:44 | no leads | analyzing #1
15:05 | the chronic problem is that when i don't really know what to do, I just kind of give up | break
