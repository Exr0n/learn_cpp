## Contest Timeline

| Time | Note | Next |
|----|----|----|
12:10 | start | reading problems
12:20 | read problems, seem doable but needs analysis | analyzing #3
12:28 | not sure how to do full data limit.. but I think I can get half credit | coding brute #3
12:41 | coded but RE 0? | debugging brute #3
12:44 | welp TLE 0 | analyzing #2
13:16 | have problem frame for #2 but not sure how to write equation / how to order the states | analyzing #2
13:36 | not sure how to reduce.. might as well code it i guess | coding #2 (expect TLE)
14:15 | severe miscalculation.. up to 4 means i need 3 bits | coding #2
14:32 | RE 0 stack overflow probably.. maybe use a manual stack but not now | debugging #3
14:38 | uh 5/20 cases is not 50%, RE 15 | analyzing #3
14:44 | no leads | analyzing #1
15:05 | the chronic problem is that when i don't really know what to do, I just kind of give up | break

## Contest Reflection

### Knowledge

#### Problem 1:

I originally thought it was knapsack, found 2^N and MN solutions but didn't know where to go on from there.

#### Problem 2:

pretty clearly a complicated DP. I avoided it at first but because other problems were difficult I started grinding out the equation. In the end, I only managed to get a top down method with roughly 10^7 states with logN transition, which would be too slow. In the end I coded it, but it stack overflowed (which I did not but should've seen coming). 

#### Problem 3:

Math, I also avoided this problem. After thinking about it for a little I gave up.. on all of the problems.

### Strategy
I think the problem is that when I get stuck on a problem (don't know what direction to think it in) then it's hard to keep grinding it out. Maybe I just need more practice with the basics? Or to summarize and connect things we've learned on a per problem level?

### Action item
practice standard algorithms, reflect on things we've learned and think about what problems are related and how.
