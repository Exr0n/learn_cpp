## Contest Timeline

| Time | Note | Next |
|----|----|----|
16:30 | start | reading problems
16:39 | 1 seems mathy, 2 maybe centroid decomp, 3 maybe graph coloring? | analyzing #3
16:57 | not sure how to do it | analyzing #2
17:16 | should code brute force first | coding #2
17:40 | hold up, you multiply them not add them | analyzing #2
17:46 | ack | analyzing #1
18:07 | do be bashing small cases though | analyzing #1
18:29 | welp | coding brute #3
18:46 | don't actually know how to brute force this | walk
18:56 | I remembered what I was gonna do | coding brute #3
19:01 | oh wait I remembered why what I was gonna do was wrong | analyzing #3
19:10 | bruh | coding bruter #2
19:18 | WA 30, apparently can get 70 w/o TLE? | debugging #2
19:26 | TLE 70, it was bc i wasn't modding enough apparently | end

## Contest Reflection

### Knowledge
that went poorly

#### Problem 1:

Pretty sure it's a math problem, and that each individual ring is somehow solvable and you can maybe DP on the solution after precomputing each ring? Spent some time bashing small cases and noticed that when playing alternately, each ring will have the second player wins. But I didn't know how to think about multiple rings, or whether it was true for bigger numbers.

#### Problem 2:

thought it was something like rootless + another chain addable condition, but realized that K was small. Not sure how to do it.. maybe DP? But a star would still TLE.

#### Problem 3:

No clue how to do this.. tried framing as a graph problem but found nothing.

### Strategy
Probably should have started coding brute forces earlier. Did not feel very motivated today.

### Action item
I don't know. practice math?
