## Contest Timeline

| Time | Note | Next |
|----|----|----|
15:06 | start | reading problems
15:12 | read problems, 1, 3, 4 seem doable, 2, 5 need analysis | coding #1
15:25 | AC #1 | coding #3
15:47 | AC #3 | coding #4
16:02 | dijkstra wa 0 | debugging
16:06 | not sure why it's WA | analyzing #5
16:09 | problem is unclear about whether you can modulo inside dijkstra, will just try it with code from #4 | coding #5
16:22 | is my dijkstra just wrong? | analyzing #2
16:44 | legit dunno how to do cereal | analyzing #2
17:15 | wait, can you show that there will be amortized O(N) updates? | psudocoding #2
17:24 | what about senority during jumping? | analyzing #2
17:29 | this should hopefully work | coding #2
17:54 | not sure whats wrong with this or dijkstra | end 

## Contest Reflection

### Knowledge
What knowledge did you use in this test, and which part you didn't do well knowledge-wise?

#### Problem 1:

binary search, check function was kind of scuffed but worked with not much debugging

#### Problem 2:

not sure how to do it #todo

#### Problem 3:

KMP, had to re-derive but somewhat remembered code structure, not too bad.

#### Problem 4:

Simple dijkstra. Not sure why my code doesn't work #todo

#### Problem 5:

Used same dijkstra code, also don't know why it doesn't work. Just multiply should be fine right? #todo

### Strategy

Strategy was okay, although I ran out of time because I couldn't figure out what was wrong with problems 2, 4, 5. End of patience anyways.

### Action item

Practice. Hard to get motivation so this might be difficult.
