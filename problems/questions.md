- test strategies
    - how do you spend time during a test? brute force first?
        * be able to estimate how much time it takes to do a problem
            * read more problems
            * don't need to code all of them, just know the algorithm
                * you should write some cod, but not for all problems
    - what's your process for solving a contest problem?
        - are most problems paper work, creative thinking or have you seen the problem type before?
            * it depends
                * if the exam is easy, then you know how to do it immidiately
                * if the exam is hard, you might have no idea after reading it so you need write notes
                - how to write notes?
                    * figure out how the sample input became the sample output
                    * do the sample test case by hand
                - how do you know its dp?
                    * for easy problems you just know its dp
                    * for hard ones you need to figure out subproblems
    - tips for writing and debugging?
- general advice
    - one piece of advice
        * work hard ig
    - something you wish you knew when you started
- training advice
    - how do you avoid burning out?
    - why did you start doing this?
    - what motivates you
    - how do you rest and relax?
- looking forward
    - is there more content to learn or do we just have to become more familiar with it?
    - what sets a successful OI player apart from the others?
        brains, determination, motivation, knowledge, habits, goals, planning?
    - how long is the road ahead?
- did you take exams?
    * took 2 or 3 usaco exams but 5-6 years ago
    * usaco problems are more and more difficult
- template codes for algorithms vs code on the fly?
    * template is important
    * but you need to write ur template code urself
- how much time spent practicing old problems vs learning new algorithms?
    * new algorithms are less important that classic algorithms
        * if theres a really new algo then most students won't know it, so they won't put in that problem
- what from OI do you use in ur job
    * coding and math
    * algorithms: DP, graph algorithms, some data structures
    * how to think about and solve problems
- most difficult part of OI for u
    * geometry problems 
- what kind of math is needed
    - discrete mathmatics
    - counting and probability
