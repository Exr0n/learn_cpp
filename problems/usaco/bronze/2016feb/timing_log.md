# 2016 Febuary Bronze Contest (played 28 Dec 2019)

| Time | Note | Next |
13:10 | start | reading problems
13:20 | have plans for #1 and #2 | writing #2
13:40 | actually I don't undertand the sample test case, the lowest number I can get is 76?? | writing #1
13:52 | AC #1 with top down DP | analysing #3
14:02 | I think I know how to do #3: just take medians | writing #3
14:28 | #3 only test case works, all others WA | debugging
14:37 | still can't figure out why my approach doesn't work | writing bashy version of #3 for points
14:44 | bashy version of #3 got 6/10 cases | analysing #1 again
14:50 | still don't understand #1 (the sample test case makes no sesnse to me) | writing python compare script to figure out the difference between bashy and broken normal version of balancing
15:00 | got problem #2 explained to me, I couldn't figure out the sample test case because I kept treating the first number as a room number instead of the number of rooms | writing bashy #2 now
15:08 | AC #2 (bashy) | working on debugging #3 again
15:44 | legit version of #3 still doesn't work, it even broke for the sample case...
