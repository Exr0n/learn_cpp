## Contest Timeline

| Time | Note | Next |
11:37 | start | reading problems
11:45 | have plans for 1, maybe 3 | coding #1
11:48 | realize that 1 might be harder than I thought because the total diff < K not diff from one < K | analysing #1
11:53 | AC #1 (was slightly different from what I originally thought but still works the same) | analysing #2
12:06 | have plan for bashy #2 (2.6e7 ops) | coding a mock up? might switch to #3 if takes too long
12:30 | finished overlap func for #2, this is taking a while | will work on it for another half hour before pausing to check #3
12:46 | this over lap func is actually not functional, and this problem is too difficult in general | moving on to #3
12:56 | have plan for #3 | coding #3
13:06 | AC #3 | working on #2 i guess
13:34 | shift code seems to work | now its time to put it all together
