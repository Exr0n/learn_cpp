## Purify Notes

### Problem 1: billboard

Although there is a mathy way to do this faster, I have left my original code in place as `main` because it is easy to write and debug.

### Problem 2: shuffle

This code was not modified because it is rather simple and uses the same approach as given in the USACO solution.

### Problem 3: meausurement

The purify version of this code is the same as my original code, but uses a boolean array instead of bitwise flag storage. [purify_measurement](xmeasurement/xpurify_measurement.cpp)
