## Contest Timeline

| Time | Note | Next |
|----|----|----|
14:00 | start | reading problems
14:07 | have plans for all three problems, they seem suspiciously simple... | coding #1
14:11 | AC #1 (first try, almost no debugging) | coding #2
14:26 | AC #2 (some debugging due to non-trivial logic) | coding #3
14:34 | AC #3 (little to no debugging) | checking answers and purifying

## Purify Notes

### Problem 1: crossroad

This problem was not modified because it uses the same approach as the USACO provided solution.

### Problem 2: circlecross

This problem was not modified beacuse it uses a similarly written approach as the USACO solution. It is unclear which is "simpler" but I believe mine is good enough.

### Problem 3: cowqueue

This problem was not modified because I use a simpler method of getting the next processed cow than the USACO solution, by using stl merge_sort (`nlogn`) instead of a custom selection sort.
