| time | note | next |
11:05 | start contest | reading problems
11:12 | read all problems, only see path in #1 | working on #1
11:25 | first version of gymnastics done, (9/10, missing #2) | analysing problem 2
11:31 | decide to use pi func from my repl kmp sketch (allowed in rules) | writing cpp impl of #2
11:39 | finished first version of #2, ac (1, 2, 4, 9), others wa | analysing problem 3
11:55 | pause analysis of #3 | work on fixing #2 
12:09 | AC #2: finish modified version of #2, running n^2, all AC | analysing problem 3 again
12:20 | have idea for basic brute force impl | start writing dumb brute force version of #3
12:52 | finish first nieve brute force for #3, permutation func broken | working on fixing #3
13:05 | AC #3 using next permutation, **go back and write a legit version!** | working on fixing #1
13:19 | AC #1, edge case was if k==1. **AK** | now working on rewriting #3
13:41 | AC #3 using custom permutation func, AK confirmed | END.
