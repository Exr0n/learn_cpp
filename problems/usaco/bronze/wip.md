## Unsolved during contest

**These problems were either not solved during the course of the contest due to lack of skill or were poorly written and needed significant purification.**

| Problem | Notes |
[bronze2014dec cowjog](./2014dec/xcowjog/purify_cowjog.cpp) | Read the problem wrong, had cows moving backwards
[bronze2015jan meeting](./2015jan/xmeeting/purify_meeting.cpp) | Was written with two dfs functions, consolodated and purified to use less storage and code
[bronze2015feb cow](./2015feb/xcow/new_cow.cpp) | Misunderstood dp dimensions
[bronze2015dec paint](./2015dec/xpaint/xpurify_paint.cpp) | Used bashy method instead of mathy one
[bronze2016jan angry](./2016jan/xangry/xpurify_angry.cpp) | Purify to simulate only furthest explosion instead of all of them, then subtract indicies
[bronze2016feb balancing](./2016feb/xbalancing/bash_balancing.cpp) | Didn't realize that I could take advantage of only checking around places that matter
[bronze2016open bcs](./2016open/xbcs/new_bcs.cpp) | **WIP** rewriting with less logic (practical longer runtime, same complexity) based on USACO soln
[bronze2017jan cowtip](./2017jan/xcowtip/xpurify_cowtip.cpp) | Didn't realize that any of the "furthest" ones (only one rectangle can toggle) would work, originally written with diagonal traverse but rewritten with simpler horizontal traverse
[bronze2017jan hps](./2017jan/xhps/xpurify_hps.cpp) | Didn't realize that I only need to check two posibilities instead of all permutations of three elements
[bronze2017dec billboard](./2017dec/xbillboard/xmain_billboard.cpp) | Used bashy method instead of mathy one
[bronze2017dec measurement](./2017dec/xmeasurement/purify_measurement.cpp) | Rewrote to use less varibables and no bitwise
