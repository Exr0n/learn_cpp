| Time | Note | Next |
|----|----|----|
15:17 | start | reading problems
15:27 | don't know 1, 2; #3 looks familiar | analysing #3
15:41 | did the binary search algebra, still don't know why it works | 
16:38 | would have a way to do #2 in `ElogV` if I could check whether adding an edge creates a cycle in a DAG in O(log V) | analysing #2
16:55 | don't know how to prevent loops | analysing #1
17:01 | don't know if this works, but trying to just count number of inversions | coding #1

## Contest Reflection

### Knowledge
What knowledge did you use in this test, and which part you didn't do well knowledge-wise?

#### Problem 1:

-

#### Problem 2:

I was trying to build the graph and process observations as they came in, which was why I ended up looking for a way to detect loops on the fly.  
I probably should've seen the binary search coming when I realized that the missing complexity was log n.

#### Problem 3:

-

### Strategy
How did you spend your time during the test, and whether there's any issue about your strategy?

### Action item
How would you change your homework, your mastery of knowledge, or class time etc in order to do better next time?
