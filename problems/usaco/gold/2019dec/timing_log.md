## Contest Timeline

| Time | Note | Next |
|----|----|----|
16:05 | start | reading problems
16:34 | have plan for #3, dunno how to do others | coding #3
16:45 | RE #3 | debugging #3
16:50 | don't know how to reduce memory usage | analysing #1
17:15 | don't know how to do #1 | analysing #2
17:38 | also don't know how to do #2 | debugging #3
17:47 | stringid RE or MLE on sample test case :// | debugging #3
18:02 | why is it different on my computer vs grading server?? | debugging #3
18:09 | dunno how to debug | pause
continue 8 Aug 2020 @ 10:59 | continue | refreshing memory
11:08 | no plan for #1, #2 feels like spojcot but must be simpler, #3 is floyd then edit dist? | analysing #3
11:23 | not sure how to improve N^2 palendrome-like spliting | analysing #2
11:25 | wait, static makes simple, just store prefix freq? how to store? | analysing #2
11:29 | I guess I should just code the spojcot pst | coding #2
12:04 | taking a while to code but might as well grind it out | coding #2
12:17 | WA 3/15 #2 | debugging
12:29 | not sure why its WA, trying more cases i guess | debugging
12:36 | not sure what's wrong | analysing #3
12:37 | I guess I should code the brute force for #3 | coding brute force #3
12:47 | #3 isn't working, probably fenceposts somewhere | coding #3
13:00 | found the fencepost a minute after time, forgot to do file i/o anyways | nosub 1, WA #2 3/15, nosub 3

## Contest Reflection

### Knowledge
What knowledge did you use in this test, and which part you didn't do well knowledge-wise?

#### Problem 1:

seems scary

#### Problem 2:

spojcot but static. not sure why it WA'd

#### Problem 3:

Not sure how to do the conversion DP, although its cool that you can use floyd to compress paths I guess.

### Strategy
How did you spend your time during the test, and whether there's any issue about your strategy?

### Action item
How would you change your homework, your mastery of knowledge, or class time etc in order to do better next time?
