## Contest Timeline

| Time | Note | Next |
|----|----|----|
15:44 | start | reading problems
15:56 | have vauge plans for 1, 2 | analysing #3
16:13 | did some thinking on #3, some insights but still no plan | psudo-coding #1
16:17 | finish `op` psudocoding for #1 | coding #1
16:56 | TLE #1 4/12 (really bad) | psudo #2
17:00 | may have a hard time writing N^2 check function | analysing #2
17:08 | actually works as long as each cow can be put into a group in O(N), which happens as long as one group is incompatible with the cow given some min dist, but what to do if no groups "collide"? | analysing #2
17:17 | have idea for n^2 checking with disjoint set | psudo #2
17:22 | psudocode should work | coding #2
17:44 | #2 doesn't work for sample test case, I think the binary search is broken.. | debugging #2
17:58 | realize that order of `x` and `y` in dist matters, you have to take max, TLE (got 9/15) | debugging #2
