## Contest Timeline

| Time | Note | Next |
|----|----|----|
10:40 | start | reading problems
10:48 | read problems, 1, 3 seem doable | analyzing #1
11:00 | not sure how to count number of cells | analyzing #3
11:11 | not sure how to deal with squares in #3 | analyzing #3 brute
11:22 | have 50% bruteforce plan for #3 | analyzing #2
11:36 | dunno #2 | coding brute #3
11:57 | TLE 5/20 #3 | coding brute #3 part 2
12:34 | brute part 2 broke | coding brute #3
12:43 | brute too scuffed | analyzing brute #1
12:50 | can do N^3 | coding brute #1
13:25 | bfs scuffed, don't understand sample #2 | hm
13:30 | rolling without it | coding brute #1
13:53 | WA/TLE 3/20 #1 | debugging #1
14:15 | dfs finally works as expected (prev actually did the sample which I don't understand?) | awaiting grade
14:17 | WA/TLE (mostly WA) 2/20 now | rereading problem
14:21 | dont understand why so wa | trying edgecases
14:40 | did I understand the problem wrong? | end

## Contest Reflection

### Knowledge
What knowledge did you use in this test, and which part you didn't do well knowledge-wise?

#### Problem 1:

I thought many BFSs would TLE, but only one test case did. However, basically all WA. Didn't understand the problem?

#### Problem 2:

More difficult analysis that I didn't understand

#### Problem 3:

had brute force plans for some parts of the data, but only got 25% (other was too difficult to implement).

### Strategy
In hindsight, I should have spent more time on #1 instead of the difficult #3 brute force.

### Action item
Practice coding things.
