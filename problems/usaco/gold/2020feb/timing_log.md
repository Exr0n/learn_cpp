## Purify Notes

### Problem 1:

-

### Problem 2:

-

### Problem 3:

-

1. Knowledge
For the first problem, I just used recursive/top down DP. That problem was not too hard.
I didn't know what to do for the second problem. I realized towards the end that `l_i` and `r_i` were small and that we could do some kind of prefix sum, but I didn't know where to go from there and kind of gave up.
For the third problem, I just used DFS. It was not too hard to think of, but was not too easy to debug. I need to polish that code later.
2. Strategy
I think I spent my time during the contest pretty well. I don't think I could have solved the second problem anyways.
3. Action item
I need to review more graph problems and DP content, as well as practicing writing cleaner code, especially DFS.
