| Time | Note | Next |
|----|----|----|
09:58 | start | reading questions
10:16 | don't know how to do any | analysing #3
10:32 | unsure how to do #3 | analysing #2
10:42 | also dunno about #2 | analysing #1
11:04 | and #1...... | break
11:21 | break | analysing #2
11:47 | have plan for #2 | psudocoding
12:00 | #2 might be too slow | coding #2
12:34 | finished coding | debugging #2
12:48 | need to figure out how to prevent doublecount, PIE? | break
12:51 | break, should've psudocoded the counting | how to count?
12:54 | just don't try too hard, zero special case is good enough, MLE/RE #2 | debugging
12:59 | one side expansion isn't going to work | coding brute force solutions
13:13 | finish coding djikstra for #3, WA and TLE | debugging
13:24 | not even sure how to brute force #1 | end 1/11, 1/15, 3/15

## Contest Reflection

### Knowledge
What knowledge did you use in this test, and which part you didn't do well knowledge-wise?

#### Problem 1:

I don't even know how to deal with the squared, especially since there are loops. Perhaps there is a sorting property? But I didn't find one.

#### Problem 2:

I spent the most time on this problem, coding a solution that was basically top down dp but only when the query came in. It was technically too slow, but I didn't have a better idea. I thought it would be atleast fast enough to get half credit, but it just MLE'd.  
I ended up only getting one contest during the time.

#### Problem 3:

I couldn't figure out how to do this in less than N^2, be it sweep line, or djikstra. I thought about it as a binary search problem, but didn't find a way to check in O(N).

### Strategy
How did you spend your time during the test, and whether there's any issue about your strategy?

### Action item
How would you change your homework, your mastery of knowledge, or class time etc in order to do better next time?

Need to think about memory complexity as well as time complexity.

Need to get better at grinding out intense paperwork... am I giving up too easily?
