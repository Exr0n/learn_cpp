## Contest Timeline

| Time | Note | Next |
|----|----|----|
09:10 | start | reading problems
09:19 | have idea for 2, but all need more analysis | analysing #1
09:42 | fleshed out N^2 for #1, but it's too slow | analysing #1
09:56 | unsure how to make #1 faster | analysing #2
10:03 | have plan for #2 | quickly coding #2
10:15 | don't understand the sample case for #2 | analysing #2
10:19 | why should 1 be the same as 4 and 5? | analysing #3
10:43 | have some analysis -- can get 1..N and LCM of prime decomposers (primes that sum to less than N) | takinga walk
10:49 | we can get all diverse numbers (no duplicate prime factors) whose factors add to less than N | analysing #3
10:56 | but we can get more numbers, like 12 from 10 (4, 6) and also non-basic cycles (6 thru 5 by 5 in len 10) | analysing #3
11:03 | there's too many options | analysing #2
11:12 | finally understand why #2 has 1 = 4 = 5... cow 2 admires both 1 and 4 so 1=4 | analysing #2
11:34 | how to use disjoint merge? | analysing #2
11:48 | seems like I have to manually put the edges together, O(n)... wait i can use linked lists | psudocoding #2
11:54 | seems legit | coding #2
12:14 | WA/RE #2 | debugging
12:18 | dunno what's wrong | analysing #1
12:26 | I think I can get the second step to O(N), but not the first... | psudocoding #1
12:30 | step 2 optimization works on sample | coding brute force #1
12:48 | WA and RE #1... why? | taking a walk
12:51 | I don't kno why everything is broken | debugging #2
