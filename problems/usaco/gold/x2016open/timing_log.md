## Contest Reflection

### Knowledge
What knowledge did you use in this test, and which part you didn't do well knowledge-wise?

#### Problem 1: split

Simple enough, vertical or horizontal line seperates, prefix/postfix min/max to compute sizes

#### Problem 2: closing

felt like DJS, didn't realize I could do it in reverse.

#### Problem 3: 248

Was looking for a greedy approach after last time, forgot that DP could work. Having such low bounds threw me off.

### Strategy
How did you spend your time during the test, and whether there's any issue about your strategy?

### Action item
How would you change your homework, your mastery of knowledge, or class time etc in order to do better next time?
