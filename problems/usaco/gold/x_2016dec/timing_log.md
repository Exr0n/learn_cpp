10:59 | have general plans for all, can do #1 | analyzing #1
11:01 | should work | coding #1
11:10 | AC #1 | analyzing #2
11:24 | it should work? | coding #2

## Contest Reflection

### Knowledge
What knowledge did you use in this test, and which part you didn't do well knowledge-wise?

#### Problem 1:

MST

#### Problem 2:

Felt like DP (state split at how many cows of each type plus another dimension to store previous location). Took a while to debug.

#### Problem 3:

Pretty sure it was BFS, the map of vectors idea was just an optimization to avoid descritization.

### Strategy
I think strategy was pretty good (and luckly problems were not too difficult).

### Action item
Practice coding / debugging things faster.
