## Contest Reflection

### Knowledge
What knowledge did you use in this test, and which part you didn't do well knowledge-wise?

#### Problem 1:

tried merging sets, but i'm not sure how to actually do it. centroid decomp? some weird offline thing?

#### Problem 2:

dp... maybe binary search. Not sure how to do it, but its probably similar to the cow talent show problem analysis?

#### Problem 3:

I think it's also DP, but I also don't know how to do it.

### Strategy
giving up in the middle, so not much to say about strategy.

### Action item
look at more dp problems.
