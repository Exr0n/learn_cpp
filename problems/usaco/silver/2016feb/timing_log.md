19:57 | have bashy plan for #1 | coding #1
20:10 | #1 is hard to code | analysing #2
20:14 | should have a plan for #2 (same as bronze) | coding #2
20:30 | 9/10 balancing (last one WA) | debugging using set
20:37 | nvm, fixing it with sets is too difficult for now (not a random access iterator, so I would need to sort by values in an array and grab the value at the start index, then search the set for it.) | analysing #3
20:54 | give up on dp equation writing, just going to dfs #3 | pause for sleep
