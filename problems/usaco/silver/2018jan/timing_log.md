# Contest usaco/silver/2018jan - played Wed 19 Feb 2020 @ 18:01 (PST)

## Contest Timeline

| Time | Note | Next |
|----|----|----|
18:01 | start | reading problems
18:13 | have plan for #2 | analysing #3
18:27 | have plan for #3 | coding #3
18:54 | 6/10 #3 (others RE) | coding #2
19:05 | realize that I actually can't treat #2 as O/1 knapsack because making some decision about cow `i` yields a different value based on previous decisions. Also, there are just too many states to encode | analysing #1
19:31 | have bashy n^2 plan for #1 | coding #1
19:27 | bashy plan doesn't work because alone-time can get split into two segments by another lifegaurd | giving up

## Purify Notes

It seems like this contest was mostly about descrete scanning, which I guess I'm not so great at because I didn't solve any of the problems. In particular, I think I got RE on problem three because of stack limit exceeded, while the usaco answer uses BFS and an N^3 algorithm that happens to work.

Anyways, I need to think more about how to replace recursion with iteration and what things to descretize for more efficient scanning.
