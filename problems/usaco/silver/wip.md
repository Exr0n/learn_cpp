| Problem | Notes |
|----|----|
[2016jan angry](./2016jan/xangry/xnew_angry.cpp) | Didn't think of binary searching for `R`
[2016jan div7](./2016jan/xdiv7/xmain_div7.cpp) | Didn't understand how to use prefix trees with modulo, or notice that two prefixes with same mod 7 meant interval between them was a multiple of  7
