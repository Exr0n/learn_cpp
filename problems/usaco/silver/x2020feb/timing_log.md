## Contest Timeline

| Time | Note | Next |
|----|----|----|
12:55 | start | reading problems
13:10 | don't have any plans | analysing #1
13:24 | have plan for #1 | coding #1
13:54 | AC #1 | analysing #2
14:42 | have ish plan for #2 (prefix sums for absolute values) | writing proof of concept code
15:04 | method for #2 doesn't actually work because each dimension needs to be sorted | analysing #3
15:23 | have N^2 method for #3, which should be plenty fast | coding #3
16:05 | after 20 mins of debugging, i realized that my program was right and I was wrong, AC #3 | coding bashy #2
16:14 | 6/10 bashy #2 | analysing #2 for actual solution
16:54 | AC #2  with 1 min 42 seconds to spare | end

## Purify Notes

1. Knowledge
problem one was adhoc, I used a bunch of modular arithmatic. I used prefix sums for problem 2, and stl things. This one was hard to debug. I used dfs for problem 3, which was pretty straight forward
2. Strategy
I started by reading all the problems and doing the first one which was relatievly easier. I then tried the second one but I realized that my method would be really hard to code so then I went to the third one. After coding that one I came back with about 40 minutes left, and wrote a really fast brute force solution for #2 which got 6/10 cases. I then started writing the scuffed full solution for #2 which I almost didn't finish debugging. I managed to submit it with about 2 minutes to spare, so maybe strategy can be improved on that part.
3. Action item
 I spent a lot of time doing previous contests this week which I think made me much more familiar with how to approach problems. I also flunked three tests in a row this week before taking the real one which is similar to what happened last time with bronze (failing practice tests before taking the real one) which is interesting. I think looking at previous problems and purifying them was helpful for giving me inspiration for how to solve the problems, although I didn't recall any specific problems during the test.
